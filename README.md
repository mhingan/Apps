# Java Swing Examples

## Description
This repository contains simple Java Swing applications showcasing:
- **Button Example**: Creating `JButton` components and handling click events.
- **Thread Example**: Running background tasks with `Thread`/`SwingWorker` and updating the UI safely.
- **I/O Example**: Reading from and writing to text files using Swing components (`JFileChooser`, `JTextArea`).

Each example lives in `org.example` and is meant for learning basic desktop development in Java.
